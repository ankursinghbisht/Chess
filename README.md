# Chess Game


A chess game implementation.
## Introduction

I've created a simple chess game using C++ that can be played through the terminal. The game allows two players to take turns making moves on a virtual chessboard. Players input their moves in algebraic notation, specifying the source and destination squares of their pieces. The game enforces the rules of chess, including valid piece movements, capturing opponent pieces, and checking for check and checkmate conditions. It also handles various special moves like castling and pawn promotion. The game continues until one player achieves checkmate or a draw condition is met. 
## Why I Built it?
Programming Practice: Developing a chess game involves handling complex logic, data structures, and algorithms. It's a great opportunity to improve your programming skills and gain experience in implementing game mechanics.

Learning Data Structures: A chess game involves managing the state of the board and the pieces. This was an opportunity to learn about and practice using data structures like arrays, matrices, and OOPs concepts.

Understanding Algorithms: Developing a chess game allowed me to dive into the intricacies of chess algorithms. From move generation and validation to implementing rules like castling and en passant, I got a hands-on experience in translating complex rules into code.



## How can I execute my project?

To get started with the Chess Game, follow these simple steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Install the required dependencies using `pip install`.

- Run the following command in the terminal: `g++ main.cpp boardcontrol.cpp piecemovement.cpp -o Game`.
-  Execute the 'Game.exe' file.
